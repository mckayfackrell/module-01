# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
This website provides information to a marketing agency. The codebase follows accessibility standards which allows for site optimization for search engines.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This website provides information to the marketing agency: Horiseon. When the source code of this website is viewed you'll be able to find semantic HTML elements. When you view the structures of the HTML elements you can find that the elements follow a logical structure. The icon and image elements have also been updated so that you can find accessible alt attributes. The heading attributes fall in sequential order, as does the title element.

## Contributing
This code was originally provided for a module challenge in the coding bootcamp for the UofU. I have made changes as described above in the usage section of the README. 

If there are errors or other areas that need to be cleaned up I am open to feedback and would greatly appreciate the help.

## Authors and acknowledgment

## Project status
A week long course that should be submitted on September 19, 2022. Once submitted changes will most likely cease as new repositories going over new coding features will be added and more focus will be dedicated to them.
